  abstract = {A phase transition describes the sudden change of state of a physical system, such as melting or freezing. Quantum gases provide the opportunity to establish a direct link between experiments and generic models that capture the underlying physics. The Dicke model describes a collective matter–light interaction and has been predicted to show an intriguing quantum phase transition. Here we realize the Dicke quantum phase transition in an open system formed by a Bose–Einstein condensate coupled to an optical cavity, and observe the emergence of a self-organized supersolid phase. The phase transition is driven by infinitely long-range interactions between the condensed atoms, induced by two-photon processes involving the cavity mode and a pump field. We show that the phase transition is described by the Dicke Hamiltonian, including counter-rotating coupling terms, and that the supersolid phase is associated with a spontaneously broken spatial symmetry. The boundary of the phase transition is mapped out in quantitative agreement with the Dicke model. Our results should facilitate studies of quantum gases with long-range interactions and provide access to novel quantum phases.},

In addition, we discuss what is being done, and what may be required, to increase the scale of trapped ion quantum computers while mitigating decoherence and control errors. Finally, we explore the outlook for trapped-ion QC. In particular, we discuss near-term applications, considerations impacting the design of future systems of trapped ions, and experiments and demonstrations that may further inform these considerations.},

  abstract = {When atoms in a gas are cooled to extremely low temperatures, they will—under the appropriate conditions—condense into a single quantum-mechanical state known as a Bose–Einstein condensate. In such systems, quantum-mechanical behaviour is evident on a macroscopic scale. Here we explore the dynamics of how a Bose–Einstein condensate collapses and subsequently explodes when the balance of forces governing its size and shape is suddenly altered. A condensate's equilibrium size and shape is strongly affected by the interatomic interactions. Our ability to induce a collapse by switching the interactions from repulsive to attractive by tuning an externally applied magnetic field yields detailed information on the violent collapse process. We observe anisotropic atom bursts that explode from the condensate, atoms leaving the condensate in undetected forms, spikes appearing in the condensate wavefunction and oscillating remnant condensates that survive the collapse. All these processes have curious dependences on time, on the strength of the interaction and on the number of condensate atoms. Although the system would seem to be simple and well characterized, our measurements reveal many phenomena that challenge theoretical models.},

In the 1950s, Hanbury Brown and Twiss showed that it is possible to measure angular sizes of astronomical radio sources from correlations of signal intensities in independent detectors. ‘HBT interferometry’ later became a key technique in quantum optics, and now it has been harnessed to identify a quantum phase of ultracold bosonic atoms.},

Starting from a cavity QED single atom Hamiltonian we use different routes to derive approximative multiparticle Hamiltonians in Bose-Hubbard form with rescaled or even dynamical parameters. In the limit of large enough cavity damping the different models agree. Compared to free space optical lattices, quantum uncertainties of the potential and the possibility of atom-field entanglement lead to modified phase transition characteristics, the appearance of new phases or even quantum superpositions of different phases. Using a corresponding effective master equation, which can be numerically solved for few particles, we can study time evolution including dissipation. As an example we exhibit the microscopic processes behind the transition dynamics from a Mott insulator like state to a self-ordered superradiant state of the atoms, which appears as steady state for transverse atomic pumping.},

  abstract = {We observe the formation of shock waves in a Bose-Einstein condensate containing a large number of sodium atoms. The shock wave is initiated with a repulsive blue-detuned light barrier, intersecting the Bose-Einstein condensate, after which two shock fronts appear. We observe breaking of these waves when the size of these waves approaches the healing length of the condensate. At this time, the wave front splits into two parts and clear fringes appear. The experiment is modeled using an effective one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii-like equation and gives excellent quantitative agreement with the experiment, even though matter waves with wavelengths two orders of magnitude smaller than the healing length are present. In these experiments, no significant heating or particle loss is observed.},

  abstract = {Full control over the dynamics of interacting, indistinguishable quantum particles is an important prerequisite for the experimental study of strongly correlated quantum matter and the implementation of high-fidelity quantum information processing. We demonstrate such control over the quantum walk—the quantum mechanical analog of the classical random walk—in the regime where dynamics are dominated by interparticle interactions. Using interacting bosonic atoms in an optical lattice, we directly observed fundamental effects such as the emergence of correlations in two-particle quantum walks, as well as strongly correlated Bloch oscillations in tilted optical lattices. Our approach can be scaled to larger systems, greatly extending the class of problems accessible via quantum walks.},

  abstract = {Fourier optics provides a description of the propagation of light waves based on harmonic analysis (the Fourier transform) and linear systems. The methods of harmonic analysis have proven to be useful in describing signals and systems in many disciplines. Harmonic analysis is based on the expansion of an arbitrary function of time f(t) as a superposition (a sum or an integral) of harmonic functions of time of different frequencies. The chapter begins with a Fourier description of the propagation of light in free space. The transfer function and impulse-response function of the free-space propagation system are determined. We then show that a lens may perform the operation of the spatial Fourier transform. The transmission of light through apertures is discussed, this is a Fourier-optics approach to the diffraction of light. Image formation and spatial filtering are detailed. Finally, an introduction to holography, the recording and reconstruction of optical waves, is presented. Knowledge of the basic properties of the Fourier transform and linear systems in one and two dimensions (reviewed in Appendices A and B) is necessary for understanding this chapter.},

This paper demonstrates effective six-body interactions in a system of ultracold bosonic atoms in a three-dimensional optical lattice. The coherent multi-particle interactions observed here open a new window for simulations of effective field theories and may help to enable the realization of novel topologically ordered many-body quantum phases.},
