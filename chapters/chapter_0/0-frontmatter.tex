\begin{abstract}
    In this report we investigate the possibility of using a custom-made phase plate to generate a flat potential for the creation of a 2D channel between two reservoirs in a quantum gas transport experiment. A brief introduction to transport experiments with quantum gases is presented together with a discussion on the dipole force and a review on spatial light modulation with phase plates.
    The custom-made phase plate is then characterized, with a particular focus on evaluating the flatness of the potential for different incoming beam sizes. The best results have been found for beam diameters close to \SI{5}{mm}, although the specifications required a \SI{6}{mm} beam. Some smaller findings include the development of a procedure to find the focal point and to align the phase plate to the beam. The results were observed to improve when using achromatic lenses to focus the beam after the phase plate and when adding a pinhole in the telescope to reduce aberrations.
