\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I want to thank Prof. Tillman Esslinger and Dr. Tobias Donner for giving me the opportunity to work in their group. I would also like to thank Myles and Mohsen for helping me to carry out the project, being always ready to give their valuable contributions and helping me to understand the big picture of what I was doing. Working in this group has been a great experience and I had the possibility to learn a lot.
